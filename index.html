                        <p>The most world-famous Turkish coffee (Türk kahvesi) is made by pulverizing freshly medium-roasted beans in a mortar and pestle, or grinding them very fine in a cylindrical brass coffee mill (kahve degirmeni). You can order Türk kahvesi one of four ways:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sade - plain, no sugar (fairly bitter)</li>
                                <li>Az sekerli - with a little sugar (takes off the bitter edge; less than a teaspoon per cup)</li>
                                <li>Orta sekerli - with medium sugar (sweetish; about a teaspoon of sugar for each cup)</li>
                                <li>Çok sekerli - with lots of sugar (quite sweet; two teaspoons of sugar or more)</li>

                        <p>Simit are a fast-food bread sold in the streets of Turkey. They are often eaten for a breakfast with cheese, olive, jam or yogurt. Simits are also great alone. They are light and flaky, backed to a golden brown color and topped with sesame seeds. Simits are often formed into rings and are sometimes braided.</p>

                        <h3>Doner Kebab</h3>
                        <p>Döner kebab is fillets of meat stacked on a vertical spit and roasted on a vertical grill. Döner means "turning" in Turkish. The vertical spit is rotated, or turned, in front of the heat source (charcoal, gas or electric). When the meat directly opposite the heat source is properly roasted, the spit is rotated so that the cooked meat may be sliced off with a special doner knife, and an uncooked portion of meat exposed to the fire. The supremo of döners is Iskender Kebap ("Alexander's Roast Lamb"), named for a chef in the city of Bursa who created the dish. The lamb was originally raised on the thyme covered slopes of Mount Uludag, in Bursa, and is roasted à la döner, spread atop diced flat pide bread, then topped with savory tomato sauce and browned butter and served with a dollop of yogurt on the side.</p>

                        <h3>Lahmacum</h3>
                        <p>Lahmacun is a thin yeast dough with meat filling. The almost obligatory ingredient of lahmacun is lemon juice, which is sprinkled just before serving. The traditional dish is baked on hot stones, but in the main versions it is baked in some parts. That is why the characteristic spicy taste and aroma that the real lahmacun features are supported cannot be created in the right conditions.</p>

                        <p>This turkish cuisine is usually prepared with mutton or lamb, but you can also order pies with other types of meat. The name of the dish comes from the Assyrian language and it was the Assyrians who were supposedly the creators of this dish. They ate it 2,000 years ago and later passed the recipe to the Greeks.</p>

He created a very visual kitchen, where all food is prepared visibly, so that guests can follow along. Furthermore, they have imported a two meter long copper grill from Istanbul. It will also give the room its own charm and rustic.
